# Computer-Room-Management-System
My final design of Database course, a management system of students' computer room.

Front-End: HTML + CSS + RAW JavaScript

Back-End: Node.js + Express + MySQL

Please user the <b>Live Server</b> plugin of VScode to access login.html due to CORS error, which is the convenient way I found to avoid error. I would be appreciated if someone could tell me the fundamental solution to this problem.
